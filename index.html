        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently a technician at a company called Distroflex, looking
            to improve my knowledge and skill base in the Web Development field
            as a way to explore more creative expression while putting forth good 
            work ethic.. I love to work on projects and help improve on code that 
            others have established to provide better functionality and efficiency.
            Along with that I usually check daily for whatever new updates there are
            to the field as I find them useful for keeping up with the ever changing 
            pace of tech.
